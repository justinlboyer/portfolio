I was one of the last picked for a team for most of my childhood. Amazingly , I was okay with that. I loved to ride my bike and rode it to and from work in junior high. I would ride with my friends all summer long around town. This was our freedom, these were our wheels to get to where we wanted to go. I swam every summer at the local pool, even the swim team. But never at high school level with the girls at school. I guess you could say, fear held me back somewhat. I powerwalked into my 20as, joined a gym for awhile. Started yoga in my 30as and them started having babies. Gained too much weight, 11 years later still carring it around. For awhile I been talking to myself , saying you needs this , your body need to move.But, with 4 kids I have let everyone else\u0027s needs come before my own. I also started with a whole new kind of fear, that something could happen to me and where would my children be. Crazy how we sometimes let our negative self cheat us out of life sometimes. But I can say with much joy now it is my children , now that they are older are bringing the old comfortable me back. We got kayaks this summer and have had a absolute awesome time with them. They are the best, what a feeling of peace floating along and paddling on Flathead Lake , Montana. I stared yoga again and Iam walking more.

So, when we were able to get quite a few items at only one store, we were BOTH super happy to be finished with the drudgery of shopping so that we could enjoy free time this weekend.  -- END\n\nSTART -- The item I wanted to buy was discounted 50% in the store! -- END\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e", "type": "circle"}, {"color": 0.5584461100977354, "id": "", "name": "cube32_cluster0", "size": 5, "tooltip": "\u003ch2\u003eCluster Details \u003cspan style=\"font-size:0.7em\"\u003e(node id: cube32_cluster0)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMember Distribution\u003c/h3\u003e  \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"histogram\"\u003e\n\u003c!-- Render histogram --\u003e\n\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"bin\" style=\"height:50.0px; background:rgb(70, 18, 100)\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e7.1%\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e     \n  \n\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"bin\" style=\"height:44.0px; background:rgb(68, 51, 125)\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e6.2%\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e     \n  \n\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"bin\" style=\"height:56.0px; background:rgb(58, 80, 138)\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e8.0%\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e     \n  \n\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"bin\" style=\"height:81.0px; background:rgb(46, 107, 141)\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e11.5%\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e     \n  \n\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"bin\" style=\"height:44.0px; background:rgb(36, 131, 141)\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e6.2%\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e     \n  \n\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"bin\" style=\"height:88.0px; background:rgb(33, 155, 136)\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e12.4%\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e     \n  \n\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"bin\" style=\"height:81.0px; background:rgb(51, 178, 121)\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e11.5%\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e     \n  \n\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"bin\" style=\"height:75.0px; background:rgb(94, 199, 96)\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e10.6%\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e     \n  \n\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"bin\" style=\"height:100.0px; background:rgb(155, 215, 59)\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e14.2%\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e     \n  \n\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"bin\" style=\"height:88.0px; background:rgb(220, 226, 37)\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e12.4%\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e     \n  \n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Projection Statistics --\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003c!-- Cluster Statistics --\u003e\n\n    \u003chr\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n    \u003c!-- \u003ch3\u003eCluster Statistics\u003c/h3\u003e --\u003e\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \u003ch3\u003eSize\u003c/h3\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e113\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003c!-- Membership information --\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003chr\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMembers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nSTART -- I was happy when I realized my biggest concern was how I sang after drinking. -- END\n\nSTART -- I was able to resist drink last night. -- END\n\nSTART -- My mother-in-law offered me money so I could buy some yogurt I can\u0027t afford to buy by myself.  -- END\n\nSTART -- My wife wear her favorite saree for office meeting. -- END\n\nSTART -- I found tool I had been looking for for a long time. -- END\n\nSTART -- My husband purchased a few things I like from the market. -- END\n\nSTART -- I drank 6 12 ounces glasses of water. -- END\n\nSTART -- A saw a man help a lady get something off the top shelf at the grocery store and it made me happy because I thought it was very nice of him and not something you see everyday.  -- END\n\nSTART -- Drinking a beer right now in the past 24 hours is making me happy. -- END\n\nSTART -- I found my favorite beer at a local store. -- END\n\nSTART -- The man who stole my truck last week was found and arrested this morning and I was able to get my vehicle back.  -- END\n\nSTART -- While leaving the store, I gave some food to a homeless man and he thanked me. -- END\n\nSTART -- I was able to do some shopping with the help of husband. -- END\n\nSTART -- My husband packed a surprise love note in my lunchbox.  -- END\n\nSTART -- I went grocery shopping last night and was able to save a lot of money using coupons and not buying junk food. -- END\n\nSTART -- After a long day, I picked up a six pack of beer;  I\u0027m in the process of enjoying it now. -- END\n\nSTART -- I had a totally crappy day at work, it was raining when I left the shop which was perfect for my mood.

I decided to treat myself to a cup of coffee on the way home..instead of choosing the drive through I went inside to see what donuts looked fresh. I ordered my coffee donut to go and just as I was  about to pay I heard a voice behind me say, \"I\u0027ve got it\". When I turned around I saw it was a guy from work who I don\u0027t really know but he\u0027s kind of cute. I thanked him, feeling my face getting red and said I\u0027d see him tomorrow. -- END\n\nSTART -- last month February 14 my husband gifted a wrist watch surprisingly .

As we got closer, we noticed a homeless man was sleeping on the table. He was in an old sleeping bag and had a few bags of his possessions around him. We both decided to not disturb the old man and go somewhere else. We got back in the car and I still didnt feel okay.\r\rI saw a pen and paper in my car so I wrote the guy a note: aHey there! Hereas some cash for a hot cup of coffee and some breakfast tomorrow. Hope you have a wonderful day today!a\r\rWe crept back over and I stealthily slid the note and cash under one of his bags.

Let me tell you all what happened last night. At around 7:30 pm, I brought some grocery for dinner and I did change of 100 Dollar note . Usually I donat carry that much cash with me, . And while returning from shop somehow I dropped my wallet somewhere on the road. After returning to home I searched like hell all my rooms and didnt find my wallet, ran back to shop, searched roads, my apartmentas staircase but still didnt find. Human nature : Started praying to Allah, kept murmuring aPlease Allah, Please Allaha. Let me tell you I was least bothered about money that I had inside it, I was worried for all the Govt. issued card, credit and debit cards)a|. Yeah Yeah.. go on and call me stupid, even I realized this last night. The place where I stay is Fremont which is bit interior and lot of constructions are going on. This made me think that if any worker will find how he will call me. So thinking this after 1 hour, I quit searching and consoled myself that itas gone, move on. I was sad about the Govt card and trust me, I became more sad. It was pathetic. Just after few minutes, I got an unknown call. Somewhere deep down my heart, I knew this was the call I was waiting for. I was happy, the man at other end asked me to come near his house which was around 100 meters from my place. After disconnecting the call, I rana|. (Run, Forrest, Run ! was on my mind). And finally I got my wallet back with all my cards and money inside. My eyes were wet and I thanked that uncle so much. But to my surprise, he replied, aIt wasn\u0027t me, who found ita and pointed his finger towards an African American man standing besides him. He was worker and seeing him I simply jumped on him to hug him and he was very shy. I said ton of Thanks to him but I felt Thanks was very very small word at that time, the amount of money and hard work he saved for me. I was so happy I gave him 100 Dollar from my wallet and further said Please let me know if you need any kind of help, but he was very shy he refused to take money May Allah Bless him -- END\n\nSTART -- When my friend bought me a beer and some beer snacks because he owed me one.  -- END\n\nSTART -- The party at the winery made me happy -- END\n\nSTART -- I controlled myself at the store and didnt buy junk food. -- END\n\nSTART -- My husband bought me feminine hygiene products without me asking him.   -- END\n\nSTART -- I lost my phone and the guy who found it, even though he didn\u0027t have to, waited for me a long time to give it back. -- END\n\nSTART -- not going to fast food, acheiving the goal to stop going to unhealthy restaurants and saving money -- END\n\nSTART -- I did not drink -- END\n\nSTART -- My husband purchased a new nan for me. -- END\n\nSTART -- Going to the store and picking up some rare beer -- END\n\nSTART -- I was at the bank and this woman let me get in front of her, to deposit my change.

I was in hurry and I just took the change from him and while putting it into my purse, I noticed the fifty rupees and it striked on my mind, I given him back seventy rupees and took thirty rupees from him.\r\rAfter giving him back his money, he was really very happy that I haven\u0027t took the advantage of his mistake. Now, why I\u0027m happy, I\u0027m happy because, I knew that I\u0027m honest but sometime when you realise your honest self, it\u0027s a pleasure for you, it\u0027s a happiness for your soul and this happiness everyone should have in their life at least once, in whatever way it comes. -- END\n\nSTART -- My wife and me went to near by shop their we lost our purse.

Read the first part for the whole story.\r\rA\rGRA, Uttar Pradesh, India a As soon as my train to Agra leaves from Delhi, I find myself confused again. Iam lying on my reserved upper berth, though most of the train car beds arenat being used and almost all of the passengers are sitting on lower seats. I feel ridiculous, like Iam emperor of my train car, overseeing the rest of the passengers from above. Meanwhile, men pass by below me, offering a mysterious vegetarian curry out of industrial-sized buckets. I motion for one to serve me some on a paper plate, but when I try to pay for the food, he wonat accept any money. This is the first time Iave gotten anything for free in India. I conclude that the food is going to kill me.\r\rWhile Iam eating, the train makes a stop and passengers disembark, but the conductor makes no announcements. I canat see through any of the trainas tiny lower windows from my upper bunk. I have no idea where I am.\r\raIs this Agra?a I ask a man sitting below me. I ask as nicely as possible, in an attempt to avoid appearing as a self-righteous train car emperor, shouting questions to my serfs. After all, I remember, Taj Mahal-builder and Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son soon after the Taj Mahalas completion. The man below shakes his head and, in Hindi, I think he tells me that we still have a long ride to Agra. Another man walks by selling non-vegetarian food in foil tins. The first shots of an intestinal war have already been fired as a result of my free bucket food, so I decline. As the train chugs toward Agra, stopping at stations along the way, I find myself continuously recruiting new serfs below me to keep track of where we are. By the time Iam halfway through the journey, I have an eighteen year old kid, two Indian soldiers, and a young woman a none of whom can speak English a trying to assist me. Itas easy to accidentally aggregate helpers on the train; mercifully, Indians tend to be especially protective of clueless Westerners trying to make sense of Indian public transportation. At one point, the two Indian soldiers demand that a teenager move his feet resting on my berth, and the young woman makes food recommendations as buckets whisk by. Theyare kind of like four Train-Fairy Godmothers. Soon, I fall asleep.\r\rSuddenly, I awake to the sound of four Indians chanting aAgra! Agra!a in unison. I abruptly end my time as train car emperor, jump down from my bed, thank the four of them, and catch a taxi to my Agra guesthouse. Before he leaves, I arrange for my taxi driver to pick me up at 6 AM the next morning to take me to the Taj Mahal.\r\rIn the morning, I tell my driver to take me to the East Gate of the Taj Mahal. He promptly takes me to a roundabout near the West Gate instead a though his aEast Gate!a announcement upon our arrival is quite convincing. Indiaas perpetually dishonest taxi drivers always have ulterior (and sometimes mysterious) motives; in this case, he was trying to save gas by taking me to the Gate closer to my hotel and, according to Lonely Planet, possibly collect a kickback from camel and rickshaw drivers sitting near the West Gate waiting to take tourists to the Tajas ticket office. I donat bother to argue with him since thereas not much time until sunrise, and I walk quickly to the entrance. Standing in line with about twenty other mostly Indian tourists, Iam surprised to see a lack of Westerners a I imagined that every white person in India would be flocking to the Taj Mahal.\r\rFinally, the doors open, and I catch my first glimpse of the building considered to be the most beautiful in the world, one whose creator boasted that it made athe sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes.a I see the famous white, marble dome peeking through the arch of the Great Gate as tourists hold cameras high above their heads to get their first snapshot. I walk deliberately toward and around the Taj, soaking in the dawn, slowly taking photos from every possible angle. A handful of photographers gather in front of the adjacent Taj Mahal mosque with me to capture the sun as it rises behind it. Everyone is reverent, taking care not to interfere with othersa photographs and offering to help take posed pictures. The moment is perfect for the photographer gaggle: mist blankets the Yamuna River behind the structure, and the building looks like it has risen spontaneously from a clouded heaven, a concrete manifestation of nirvana.\r\rThe simple presence of the Taj, built as a symbol of eternal love by Emperor Jahan in memory of his third wife who died during childbirth, seems to encourage even rabid photographers to cooperate with each other.\r\rI spend almost two hours touring and photographing the Taj, walking around its walls, admiring the calligraphy on the entrance arch, gazing at the minarets, and touching the intricate lattice screens in the mausoleum interior. Iam just about finished, taking a few final classic Taj Mahal reflection pool photographs from outside, when a beautiful, young blond woman performing playful, provocative poses for her friends camera catches my eye. Soon, a string of Indian men, and some Indian families too, start interrupting to ask her to pose with them in souvenir photos.\r\raThe Indian tourists seem more interested in your white skin and blond hair than the white marble of the Taj Mahal,a I say to her. aIam pretty sure a lot of these Indian guys are leaving with more pictures of you than the Taj.a\r\rShe chuckles and introduces herself to me as Sophie, from France, and, quickly, weare trading funny stories of our travels through India. We like each other immediately. We find ourselves chatting in front of the Tajas reflection pool for about a half hour as Indian men gawk at us. But when Sophie and I realize that weare headed in opposite directions a she toward Amritsar in northern India and me toward Kerala in southern India a we share an awkward moment during which we realize that this is the one and only meeting of our entire lives.\r\rwell, it truly has been a pleasure, Hank,a she says. Her eyes hold on mine. For a long moment, she doesnat look away. I canat tell whether sheas staring at me or at the exquisite reflection of the Taj Mahal in the pool behind me.\r\rShe walks past me, in front of the rising sun. Then, she glances back at me one last time, smiles, and then shifts her gaze, once again, toward the world\u0027s most beautiful symbol of eternal love. -- END\n\nSTART -- I left my key in my motor cycle and searched for half an hour. My neighbor house uncle came and gave the key and I was very happy.  -- END\n\nSTART -- When i got to the train station it just pulled up and i was able to get a seat.  -- END\n\nSTART -- today morning i went to shopping at that time i seen one accident that is very unforgettable .a small boy were crossing the road at that time one man who were ride his cycle very fast and he were kick the boy from his cycle unfortunately ,the boy were fell down and he were get wounds in his leg and hand .he were shouted lot and cry .then i were went closer to that boy and i took him to the hospital and return safe to his home. -- END\n\nSTART -- Today afternoon 2.00 p.m  my husband suddenly planned for vacation tour .

I was stranded and in turn lost my car and had to sit at a bus station for 12 hours and then ride a bus for another 12 hours just to get home. When my bus pulled into the station of my home town, I was happy. -- END\n\nSTART -- We the whole family went out for a hill station and its highest peak of our location. We visited many places and stayed there for three days. We really enjoyed the trip. -- END\n\nSTART -- Nostalgia has me by the throat today. Iam not sure why. In an effort to assuage it, I am sifting through old photos and there are some great ones from a holiday a few years ago. I had gone on a family holiday with my parents and two siblings to Munnar in the tea country of Kerala. We drove from Kottayam to Munnar and stayed for a weekend. That trip too was steeped in nostalgia as my father had grown up there.\r\rWhen the three of us were little kids, our favorite bedtime stories were the \u0027Munar Talesa narrated with infectious enthusiasm by my father. We were never satisfied with one and would try to wheedle more by pleading hard. His yarns portrayed what seemed to be an idyllic country life to the three of us who lived in a flat in Bombay in those days. There were tales of runaway cows, gardening attempts, going to school in the cold winter and throwing up on long bus journeys down from the hills. Munnar always seemed like a little piece of heaven to me. Around the time my father went away to college, my grandfather relocated to our hometown of Kottayam following his retirement. My father didnt return for more than thirty years in fear of tainting his cherished memories. He finally gave in when the rest of his siblings planned a trip to see if their old house, school and other favorite places were still there.\rMunnar still seems a lovely town to me if you stay away from the crowded and badly constructed main areas. But my father insists that it was much better sixty years ago when the British company Messrs Finlay Muir \u0026 Co ran the town. The town had grown due to the tea estates owned by Finlay Muir in the name of Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company. From electricity generation to hospitals, everything was set up and managed by the company but he remembers it to be an extremely well-run town. Even the roads were washed down everyday, he says. The company also ran the school where my granddad was the Headmaster and that my father attended. He recalls the Munnar Supply Association (MSA) being a shop for the British with many imported things that seemed exotic to him like cheese and preserves. We went in to take a look on that trip but there was nothing remotely exotic in there.\rLast year my parents came along on a location visit to Munnar to add properties for seek\u0026hide. We stayed at one of our favourite homestays in Munnar, Casa del Fauno and were lucky that we caught both the glorious sunset and sunrise over a steep valley. My father looked so content and happy to be back in Munnar. The next day we visited another of our hotels in Munnar, Windermere Estate. The manager mentioned that the great grandson of James Finlay had stayed with them a while ago. So we were not the only people who were making nostalgic trips to Munnar :) If you look at these pictures, it will be clear why I am a wee bit sentimental about the place too. -- END\n\nSTART -- When I got an opportunity to visit the country\u0027s capital Delhi last month, I was very happy.  It was long cherished desire of me to visit that place.  Finally I could accomplish it. -- END\n\nSTART -- our family went trip to the Delhi for taking photographs of taj mahal. it is one of the seven beauties in the world -- END\n\nSTART -- My mother\u0027s health report came and she is all good -- END\n\nSTART -- I went to visit my granny\u0027s place in my native.

He was really excited to go. I dropped him off, he got out of the car, then quickly turned back to me to give me a kiss and then said, \"I love you so much!\" and ran up the drive way.  He is 12. -- END\n\nSTART -- I got to spend a kid-free afternoon to do whatever I wanted to do. -- END\n\nSTART -- the expression of happiness and enthusiasm that my grandmother had (while she was almost unconscious, in a hospital) when she heared that I was next to her 2 days before passing away. -- END\n\nSTART -- My happy moment this month was having a patient of mine tell me thanks the day after I made her bed, after she had left the ward for a procedure. -- END\n\nSTART -- On a Tour to Bangalore to visit my daughter and friends -- END\n\nSTART -- It  was my daughter\u0027s Grand Marriage with  Beautiful Amenities and Quality food -- END\n\nSTART -- When my friend suffered minor injuries alone due to an accident made us very happy because he had a narrow escape from being hit by a bus -- END\n\nSTART -- I was happy last Friday when we had fun at the local botanical gardens because my daughter loves it there.   -- END\n\nSTART -- What made me happy in the past month was watching tv with my husband after our daughter went to bed and eating junk food with him. -- END\n\nSTART -- After six hours  the doctor said that both my baby and my wife were safe with normal health.

Weekends have been full, not very restful. I asked my husband to spend some time snuggling in bed instead of watching TV or playing the XBox, simply to spend some quality time together. We snuggled and talked and caught up on life with each other. It made me feel like I had what I needed and he said that it helped him actually relax. The feeling of coming back to a happy place together was very important to our ability to keep progressing through this final busy stretch before the baby comes.  -- END\n\nSTART -- My boss finally agreed to change my working hours to suit my parenting needs better and reduce stress coming from arranging childcare.  -- END\n\nSTART -- A moment that made me happy was when my spouse got a babysitter and surprised me to a night out and a homemade desert, and told me we where going on a road trip to visit my mom soon.  -- END\n\nSTART -- I was very happy when my eldest son found himself a great partner and they bought a home together. -- END\n\nSTART -- I had the opportunity to spend two days with my youngest daughter.

It was a long journey to Ooty from Delhi, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We reached Mettupalayam by train. From there we took another train for Wellington. This journey, in the little mountain railway, was quite exhilarating and unforgettable.\r\r\rDuring the journey we saw breath-taking scenes of Nigeria hills and forests. There were my maternal uncle, aunt, their little daughter Jasmine and 2 attendants to receive us at the station. We were overAjoyed to see and meet one another.\r\rThe following day, and then on the week-end, we visited Ooty. On both these visits we enjoyed the beauty, freshness, food walking, horse-riding and excursions. Situated at the height of 2,286 meters on Nigeria hills, Ooty is a very popular and famous hill resort of South India. It is in the state of Tamil Nadu. Full of rich tourist- activities and possibilities round the year, Ooty was discovered in 1819 by the then collector of Combater, an Englishman, Mr. John Sullivan. He constructed his summer residence there. He was the first man to do so. He was soon followed by numerous other Englishmen. It then became the summer seat of Provincial Government of Madras.\rThe temperate coolness attracts a large crowd of people from nearby areas, provinces and distant parts of the country. Originally it belonged to the Toads, a hill tribe which still lives in the Nigeria Hills. This aQueen of the Hill Stationsa is full of nice outdoor activities like hiking, boating, fishing, horse-riding, long walks, excursions and shopping. There is a big and wonderful botanical garden in the very heart of the town. It has more than 600 varieties of exotic plants and trees. We visited the botanical garden and then enjoyed boating in the lake.\r\rWe went to Deadbeats Peak in our uncle\u0027s car. From there we had an excellent panoramic view of the plains below. Is the highest point and boasts the height of 2,638 meters. There is also a telescope for the viewing pleasure of the tourists. We also visited and immensely enjoyed the nearby Samas Park, a nice picnic spot full of many varieties of plants, trees, herbs and a fine pool full of lilies.\r\rThe shopping in the small but colorful market of the town is an unforgettable experience. Mother bought a few silk sarisa, spices and some other items as gifts for our friends and relations. I bought some special tea and items of woodcraft. Ooty, overlooking blue hills and lush green valleys, is a very pleasant place and tourist resort. There was a big crowd of Indian and foreign tourists.\r\rWe also visited nearby Connor, a small but colorful town amidst sprawling tea gardens. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this still station. We also exposed a number of films to capture beautiful and natural scenes, events and memorable moments. These photographs will help us to keep our joy and memories of the place ever new and fresh. -- END\n\nSTART -- My husband stopped by my workplace to pick me up. That was a surprise!

It is an experience about helping a blind man to cross the street. I still remember that day vividly. That night I had studied at school library; it was around 10 o\u0027clock, and I prepared to go back home. As I passed through the school gate, I said goodbye to my friends. Suddenly I saw a strange thing in front of me. There was a male standing beside the cross-walk; the traffic light was green, he could walk forward, but he didnt. He was just standing there and made no actions. I was confused at this sight. Out of curiosity, I decided to walk over to him and to see what was happening. I felt perplexed until I walked next to him. Standing beside him, I could see he was wearing sunglasses and holding a white stick; then I knew this man was blind. In this cold winter day, pedestrians all wore heavy coats, including him and me. His was gray and mine was black. I also noticed that there was a sign around his neck. The sign said aI am virtually deaf and blind; please help me cross the street. Tap me on the shoulder.a I knew I must help him. So I tapped him on the shoulder, and then he put his left hand on my right shoulder and I led him across the street. All the process was quiet; the only thing I could hear was the sounds of our steps. It was a chilly night too, but I knew he would feel warm at this moment. When we got across the street, he bowed in thanks, and started walking up the block, to the next corner, then the next. While he walked past me, I couldnat help but start to weep. I wanted to walk him home. It was not a very busy street, almost deserted. He could have been there, on that corner, for 10 minutes. Maybe he is still at another corner, now, waiting. How does he get home? How does he know where his home is? Thinking of this, I cried more loudly. I canat image being deaf and blind. You would be so helpless and dependent on other people. Can you imagine going home like that every day: walking a block, then waiting for someone to help you get across the street, then walking another block, and waiting, relying on the kindness of strangers? After this incident, I realized how blessed I am. I should cherish every day and do my best to help the people who need help in my life.\r\r -- END\n\nSTART -- on the way to attend the marriage we have to travel through a small village. the place was awesome.people seemed to be innocent.the nature was beautiful.the tress all the way beautiful birds and the sound of the birds.the river flowing all the way to the side of the road.i felt really very happy. -- END\n\nSTART -- I meat my friends at Temple I am feeling better and happy -- END\n\nSTART -- When I was late but the bus was still not at the bus stop. -- END\n\nSTART -- Wife\u0027s health is good, she had a few episodes of panic attack a few months ago. -- END\n\nSTART -- My mom found out she doesn\u0027t have a serious illness. -- END\n\nSTART -- Yesterday night when I was walking from office to catch a bus, my colleague gave a lift and left me near the house. -- END\n\nSTART -- I was happy when my husband came home after leaving me a week alone on business with our twin 3-year olds. -- END\n\nSTART -- Yesterday i went to temple , there i saw my old college friend and we chat for some more time in the temple and discuss about the past life.

I am sharing my recent travel experience to Wayanad.\rWhile returning from our vacation in Ooty, we chose to drive via Gudaloor and spent a few days in Wayanad. Along with Munnar, Wayanad is considered as one of the best hill station destinations in Kerala. While going to Ooty, we drove from Kochi via Coimbatore and there was nothing much exciting in the travel other than the pleasant hills awaiting us! But the return journey was amazing. The drive from Ooty to Wayanad via Gudaloor can\u0027t be described in words. You must drive that route to enjoy the real beauty of nature in south India.\r\rAfter enjoying a drive of about 4 hours through the mist and enjoying the beauty of nature to its best, we reached Lakkidy, which is considered to be the gateway of Wayanad. Lakkidi is a small town along the national highway and is located just above the Wayanad Ghat Pass (Thamarassery ghat) and is the first place after you enter in to the boundary of Wayanad.\rOne interesting thing I learnt during my visit to Wayanad was, there is no specific town called \"Wayanad\". Instead, a large area of hills, valleys, villages and towns together are called Wayanad, which is politically called as Wayanad district. While driving from Ooty to Wayanad, we were asking for directions to Wayanad and different people showed us different directions since all those places were part of Wayanad. \r\rDuring our visit, we stayed in The Wayanad Gate Hotel for a night and we really enjoyed our stay there. Read my review of Pepper Wayanad Gate Hotel and see how we liked the place. Also, check out the budget resorts in Wayanad, where you can experience a little bit of Wayanad within the property itself. -- END\n\nSTART -- It was a delightful day yesterday as we got to visit a far away temple early morning with our close friends and i was really happy -- END\n\nSTART -- I like traveling. Iam very thankful to god because giving me a family that loves to travel. When I go for traveling with my family, there are a lot of interesting place that we visit. Between traveling at bigger city and go traveling at Island, I will choose the Island to travel. I donat like travel at bigger city because it was so noisy and a lot of pollution. Enough for me to live and always trapped in the traffic jam especially when Iam go back home to my own town Johor Bharu. My parent will take us to go for traveling especially when school holiday is coming. A wonderful holiday that I still remember until now is when my family and I went to Tioman Island when school holiday. That was the first time and first experience I went to Tioman Island. We stayed at Tioman Resort about three days. About seven o\u0027clock early in the morning, we took a car to go to Jeti Mersing from Kota Tinggi. Around nine in the morning, we arrived at Jeti Mersing and my father parked his car at there. We take a bot at ten o\u0027clock. Our journey from Jetty Mersing to Tioman Island is about one hour and thirty minute. Along travel to Tioman Island by bot, I saw many interesting scenery like a lot of monkey when our bot is near to the near Island and the water was very clean and clear blue in colour. Iam the one who was very excited to arrived at Tioman Island. At twelve noon, we safely arrived at Tioman Island. I was very excited. The scenery was very amazing with the birds flying anywhere just like to welcome us. It is so fascinating to be there. When we went out from the bot, have a car exactly like when we see when people playing a golf was waiting for us to take us to the resort. Along in the car, we found a lot of monkey was climbed the trees. The driver also looked very friendly and love to tell us about Tiomal Island. \r\r -- END\n\nSTART -- MY SON\u0027S BIRTH DAY FUNCTION.

It contains the relics of St.Framcis Xavier, Patron saint of Goa, Apostle of the Indies. The construction of the church began on the 24th November 1594 AD. It is built of black laterite stone. The relics of St Francis Xavier were kept in this chapel from 1623-55 AD. The Blessed Sacrament was earlier kept on the main altar under the statue of St Ignatius and now is preserved in a gold tabernacle. The body of St. Francis Xavier was brought here from the College of St Paul after his canonization in 1624 AD. It was shifted to its present location in 1655 AD. The crystal urn was made in the Casa Brandizzi at Rome and was brought to Goa on January 30th 1955. The old wooden coffin with its three keys is now kept in the museum at the Professed House of the Jesuits\rFrom there we headed towards Aguada Fort but it was very dark that we could not able to see the site.\rThen we went to Baga beach .. to search our second accommodation.. which again eat a lot of time.. around 1 and half hour.. and we were late and tired and had to drop pub and disk plan..:(\rThen we had our diner at Baga beach ... its an awesome experience to have diner at seashore ...( we had veg though :( Vaibhav remember 120 and mine 240 :P ) At around 12 AM we finished our most lavish \u0026 expensive diner ...and went back to take rest coz we want to get ready for water sports next morning -- END\n\nSTART -- My husband took 1/2 a day off work so he has a longer weekend off to spend with our daughter and me.  -- END\n\nSTART -- the well good best all tha would in part of the sentence that describes which house it is is the last half, hai thiess well  that\u0027s well good life in good  -- END\n\nSTART -- My husband went with me to the park today.

People finish their work and return home. Birds return to their nests. The cowboys become busy with returning home with cattle. When the sun sets, nature looks very beautiful. Then the nature starts getting dark. The slight darkness of the sunset creates a feeling of joy and tranquility in us. The beauty of the sunset helps a poet to generate any ideas and compose poems. -- END\n\nSTART -- I and my friends went to my favourite amusement park at the end of my street.

I\u0027m not one to be overdramatic, but I really felt like my whole life had led up to that point.\rBackground:\rThree weeks into my sophomore year in college, I worked a study abroad fair and found out about this AMAZING program called Semester at Sea. Basically you go on a cruise ship that was remodeled to be a floating university and study with world-renown professors as you travel around the world. Four weeks into my second year in college, I had a stroke in my brainstem. I remember finding the brochure for Semester at Sea and bawling my eyes out because everyone told me I\u0027d never walk, let alone travel internationally again. Fast forward a few years and I\u0027d recovered amazingly well from the stroke but now knew I have a genetic disease which was making me pretty sick. I sign up for Semester at Sea because I can be sick at home or be sick traveling the world. The later has better vistas. I undergo experimental surgery which dramatically (although temporarily) improves my symptoms, pack up my bags, and am ready to go.\rAs embarkation day got closer, I grew more and more scared that something was going to prevent me from getting on that ship. I was going to injure myself or get worse symptoms again or there was going to be a bloody hurricane or something. I had already tried to study abroad twice but complications from surgery had prevented me both those times. When I finally walked onto the ship, I realized that I had made it. I was about to start living my dream against all odds. And oh man was it worth every bit of work and anxiety and hope I put into getting there. It was the best and most meaningful experience of my life and it was even better because I felt like I had earned it. -- END\n\nSTART -- In these moments I am still happy after this week, to continue advancing in my projects and to enjoy next to my family of the life of a very healthy way. -- END\n\nSTART -- I recently made a presentation at work that I have been dreading for weeks and felt very upbeat and proud of myself after it was finished. -- END\n\nSTART -- I was able to help a client today and I felt very proud, useful, and happy - especially because my depression has been making me feel really useless lately. -- END\n\nSTART -- I finally got an application finished that I had been working on. -- END\n\nSTART -- I finished a project that I had been working on for several months. -- END\n\nSTART -- 3.  I worked with my brother on a volunteer opportunity that means a lot to both of us. -- END\n\nSTART -- I was able to put aside distractions and get caught up with a lot of work. -- END\n\nSTART -- I had a great conversation with a family member about a topic that was not addressed for some time and I felt very relieved that the \u0027elephant in the room\u0027 was finally discussed. -- END\n\nSTART -- There have been some nice breakthroughs at work lately that I know will lead to better things down the road.   -- END\n\nSTART -- My friends and I are making great steps on a project that we are starting together. -- END\n\nSTART -- It made me happy when I spoke to people who built their own business  -- END\n\nSTART -- Sadly, a co-worker who caused so much drama and problems at work resigned and that made me happy. Finally the drama is gone.  -- END\n\nSTART -- I had to do some really rough tasks, but it wasn\u0027t as bad as I was initially anticipating.  -- END\n\nSTART -- I completed an important project at work that I had been working on it for about two and a half weeks. -- END\n\nSTART -- I had a very successful meeting with some coworkers and it made me feel very happy. -- END\n\nSTART -- Finished a work project that I had been working on for at least 2 weeks. -- END\n\nSTART -- It made me happy to talk to former co-workers who are going through difficulties with another co-worker, and to realize that we are still as close as we were.  -- END\n\nSTART -- Getting a project completed at work that has been a long time in the works -- END\n\nSTART -- Finishing my giant project  -- END\n\nSTART -- While on my regular job, I made an additional effort to complete a task. It felt good to have more free time afterwards. -- END\n\nSTART -- Myself with other two friends decided to some business; agreement was completed by 24 hours made me very happy. -- END\n\nSTART -- Normally I am not at level of post at my work to attend weekly meeting in my office.But surprisingly I was called for that meeting to discuss confidential concerns.I was glad that I could gain their trust. -- END\n\nSTART -- I had a great meeting with some coworkers that really pushed our progress forward and made me happy. -- END\n\nSTART -- We had a team meeting at office yesterday and one of the exercise was to introduce ourselves and tell our background. I felt happy sharing my past experiences to the team -- END\n\nSTART -- I made a real friend at work: she shared that she\u0027s genderfluid, and shares many opinions about coworkers that I do. It\u0027s a relief to both of us.  -- END\n\nSTART -- One event that made me happy in the past 24 hours was being able to hold a long conversation with a coworker that seems to typically shy away from others. -- END\n\nSTART -- I spent a good part of the day with a longtime friend of mine working on repairs and renovations to our family home. It was nice to be outdoors for a change instead of being at home all of the time with my nose buried in a textbook! I\u0027ve always enjoyed doing hands-on type of work, even though I don\u0027t do it very often, and that made me happy as a result. I find that being physically engaged with a particular task diminishes my stress levels considerably for some reason. -- END\n\nSTART -- I completed a work project that had a deadline approaching and that I had been dreading finishing.  -- END\n\nSTART -- I realized I didn\u0027t have any work due tomorrow. -- END\n\nSTART -- I saw my partner smile at our brain injury support group today. -- END\n\nSTART -- In the last 24 hours I complete a project at work that was challenging.  -- END\n\nSTART -- I HAVE BEAUTIFUL FAMILY WITH FULL OF HAPPINESS, YESTERDAY MY BROTHER GOT GOVERNMENT JOB THAT WAS A WONDERFUL MOMENT IN MY LIFE . -- END\n\nSTART -- Today I went to see my therapist and we talked about the problems of my week, and was given positive ways to resolve them.

I have been feeling slow this week, but yesterday I made up for it with getting a bunch of projects complete. -- END\n\nSTART -- I completed my month end production report this morning.  It is important the final product numbers matches the raw material numbers for the plant.   Sometimes the numbers don\u0027t match and I have to spend a lot of time trying to figure out why.  Usual it something as simple as someone inputted a wrong number in a form.  Fortunately,  everything worked out as expected this month.   -- END\n\nSTART -- My co-workers and I were able to finish a work project. -- END\n\nSTART -- Finished all my work on time at my job. -- END\n\nSTART -- I was able to use a new process to more efficiently complete a task at work -- END\n\nSTART -- I was happy wen I finished all my work on time -- END\n\nSTART -- I achieved my goal of completing a project. -- END\n\nSTART -- My supervisor showed me how to change a file type that is linked to a process, which will cut my work time in half. -- END\n\nSTART -- After my internship, my boyfriend asked if he could take me out to celebrate.

But we work in the same research group) and I got together around 4 PM just to chat, without caring about anything. Our boss had left already, so we slowed down a bit just to gossip or discuss life. -- END\n\nSTART -- At work, I solved a technical problem that had been baffling me for about a week. -- END\n\nSTART -- I accomplished many goals for the day cleaning-wise including some tasks that I have not gotten around to for a long time. -- END\n\nSTART -- Got the job in Multinational Company, inclusive of myself and my family members are feels so glad, that day we enjoyed with my friends a lot.; -- END\n\nSTART -- I got some good insight into my actions when I was at my 12-step (OA) meeting. -- END\n\nSTART -- During a staff meeting yesterday we were brainstorming and making plans for an upcoming event our team is putting together. Due to the conversation and lighthearted feeling we each began sharing one liner\u0027s and making each other laugh. We were laughing so much our boss stepped out of her office wanting to get in on the conversation. Was very enjoyable, felt happy. -- END\n\nSTART -- I got to sit down with a person at work that I had a previous relationship with and was able to get my thoughts and reasonings for breaking things off out there. It gave me closure. -- END\n\nSTART -- I was postponing to sort out the mess on my writing table. Papers, gadgets, mobile phones were all dumped in a heap making the table scary.

It made me happy that good things happened to him.  -- END\n\nSTART -- I discovered a new trick to help make my tasks at work easier. -- END\n\nSTART -- when i completed all my work efficiently that i was assigned. -- END\n\nSTART -- I finish my work assignment three days before deadline, which don\u0027t happen very often. -- END\n\nSTART -- I finished a project at work. -- END\n\nSTART -- My last 24 hours were not very eventful.  I\u0027m really stretching here as the past 24 hours have been very routine for me.  However yesterday, I did finish a project at work.  I\u0027m a Unix server administrator.  As part of my job, over the many years I\u0027ve done this line of work, I have developed a number of computer programs (mostly Perl and shell scripts) to automate this and that.  Some are small some are big.  Because of a module that most of programs use has been deprecated from Perl, and because Red Hat 7, the operating system and version we are moving the servers at work to, no longer comes with that Perl module, a whole lot of my programs were going to break.  There is another module that does the job with a few tweaks to each program.  Over the past few days I have been editing all of my programs to update that module and a few other things.  I finished that today.  It is a nice feeling of accomplishment to finish something.  it was not a major project, but it\u0027s still an accomplishment.  I\u0027ll take that! -- END\n\nSTART -- Minimizing stress is a key issue in the frantic, changing 21st century world. People under stress are not alert to what is happening around them, and they are prone to oversights and mistakes. Establish a network of mutual support in your company, so people do not feel isolated and know how to get help when they need it.\r\rEncourage confidence. -- END\n\nSTART -- I created a virtual server on my laptop in Windows 2K8 OS by which anyone can access files on a drive on my laptop specified by me through a link and so it works like an online storage solution which makes me happy. -- END\n\nSTART -- I worked for a project for the last one month and the task was really hard. I did it very honestly and i finished it right now. Now i feel very happy.  -- END\n\nSTART -- I was much more social with my coworkers and it felt good to feel included. -- END\n\nSTART -- At work, I made a lot of progress on several of my projects that were previously on hold. -- END\n\nSTART -- I was able to make process on a project that I\u0027m working with and have a productive conference call that brought clarity to an issue. -- END\n\nSTART -- I was able to problem solve and overcome an issue at work. -- END\n\nSTART -- Getting my Singapore residency renewed. -- END\n\nSTART -- I was able to have some time to myself today without any distractions. -- END\n\nSTART -- I finally figured out a problem I had been having on a project at work. It had been keeping me from progressing for a week, so it was a huge load off to solve it. -- END\n\nSTART -- I am a computer professional. i was writing software program i tried in my own. But yesterday i got solution and got result for the program.

I am opposed to the belief that money makes everyone happy and replete. Although money and wealth are essential elements for human life as they help people cover their expenses, do things they want and purchase materials people want, I don\u0027t think that they are the determinant factors. Furthermore, self-contentment could be another important ingredient for us to be happy.

They are all diverse, just like the individualas in the world. Happiness is acquired through countless stimuli, whether they are material or emotional. One can not give a general definition for happiness, due to the fact that each person has their own perception of what happiness is. Happiness lies in the eye of the beholder, and as the beholder I see happiness as:Thus through this essay I will describe what happiness means to me, by discussing the above mentioned. I have found that through completing my happy Moments Journal,a that my family is a huge element of my happiness. Over half of the entries in my journal involved some interaction or thought of my family. A couple of examples include having Sunday lunch with my family. Everyone basically, comes together after church and we sit down and eat lunch together and then spend the rest of the day talking and just enjoying each others company.

I don\u0027t often feel excitement either good or bed.  Today I felt a tiny bit of excitement.  I took a previous version of this hit a day or 2 ago.  In that version, one event was that I *finally* ordered my new server (computer).  Today the case arrived.  I was about to go downstairs for lunch when I saw the mailman pull up.
